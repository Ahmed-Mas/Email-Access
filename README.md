# email-Access
Lets users set up the program with a gmail bot account that takes emails from authorized emails
The subject-line of the email allows users to control their pc by adding custom functions

Originally created for a company I worked for where sales agents could send requests to a server that would reply with some property information

I used it to start programs while I'm away, to annoy my brother by starting pyautogui while hes playing overwatch

Future hopeful updates:
  1) Makes it more user friendly by making adding config file (to change smtp/imap server, hold login info etc..)
  2) Add a bunch of functionality that I use
  3) Tons of "code cleanup" to do
